# Predicting_Rise_In_Sea_Level_Using_Neural_Network
A model developed using neural networks which is able to predict the volume of glaciers adding to rise in sea level.

# Objective
The main objective is to calculate the volume of glaciers getting melted each year which leads to rise in the sea level. The image processing is done with the help of ArcGIS software which is used for scientific calculations. The model is runes on Google Colab which provides faster computation speed and provides GPU (Graphic processing unit).

# Scope
The raw satellite images taken from Landsat satellite undergo image processing to convert them in classified raster images and the ArcGIS software calculates the area and the Surface mass balance (SMB) which is given to model which in return predicts the volume reduction in future.
